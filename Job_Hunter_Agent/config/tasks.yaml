  description: >
    You are an expert in career matching.

    Given a list of extracted jobs (JobList) and the user's resume, evaluate how well each job aligns with the user's:
    - Tech stack
    - Role level
    - Industry and company size preferences
    - Remote/work flexibility
    - Contract type
    - Salary expectations
    - Keywords and disqualifiers in the resume

    For each job, assign a `match_score` from 1 (poor fit) to 5 (perfect fit), and explain your reasoning.

    Append the `match_score` and a `reason` field to each job in the list.

    Keep all original job fields intact. Do not alter or filter out any jobs.
  expected_output: >

    - match_score: integer from 1 to 5
    - reason: a short explanation for the score
