# Interview Prep: Global Fintech Solutions – Senior Golang Developer

## Job Overview
Global Fintech Solutions is hiring a Senior Golang Developer (Rotterdam, hybrid) to help design, build, and optimize their high-throughput payment microservices. You’ll work in a 20-engineer Backend team, reporting to the Core Services Engineering Manager, collaborating closely with DevOps, Security, and Product. Key responsibilities include developing Go-based services, participating in architecture reviews, maintaining code quality, and driving observability, scalability, and security in AWS.

## Why This Job Is a Fit
- **Aligned Tech Stack**: You’ve led Node.js microservices on AWS ECS/EKS with Docker—skills directly transferable to Go services in AWS.
- **Cloud & DevOps Strength**: Your AWS certifications and hands-on CI/CD pipeline builds mirror their new AWS migration initiative.
- **Fintech Context**: You’ve integrated payment workflows (PCI-compliant) and third-party services; GFS’s payment rails platform is the next logical step.
- **Growth in Go**: You have 3 years of backend experience, strong foundations in concurrent languages (Node, Python) and are rapidly upskilling in Golang.

## Resume Highlights for This Role
- **Microservices & Containerization**  
  • Architected & deployed 5+ Docker-based microservices on AWS ECS/EKS  
  • Migrated monolith to microservices—30% uptime improvement, 50% faster onboarding  
- **Backend Performance Optimization**  
  • Reduced API response times by 25% using Redis caching & query tuning  
  • Built RESTful endpoints serving high-traffic applications  
- **DevOps & CI/CD**  
  • Designed GitHub Actions pipelines for zero-downtime deployments  
  • Introduced logging (CloudWatch) & monitoring (Prometheus) standards  
- **Payment & Security**  
  • Integrated PCI-compliant payment services, enhancing transaction reliability  
  • Assisted AWS deployments (EC2, S3, Lambda) with secure configuration  
- **Golang Focus (in progress)**  
  • Completed hands-on Go workshops; currently building small services to master goroutines, channels, and pprof  

## Company Summary
**Global Fintech Solutions**  
- Headquarters: Rotterdam, NL; hybrid model  
- Size: ~201–500 employees; Fintech/Financial Services  
- Mission: Democratize secure, low-latency payment rails worldwide  
- Products: Go-based microservices payment platform, real-time APIs, Kafka-driven pipelines  
- Recent Highlights:  
  • Closed €50M Series C (Apr ’24)  
  • New Dutch neobank partnership (May ’24)  
  • AWS migration initiative & ISO 27001 compliance (Jun ’24)  
  • CTO hire with microservices expertise  

**Core Values**: Customer Obsession, Ownership, Innovation at Speed, Integrity & Security, Collaboration & Diversity.

## Predicted Interview Questions
1. Go Language & Concurrency  
   - “Describe how you’d use goroutines and channels to implement a worker pool.”  
   - “How do you profile and optimize memory usage in Go? (pprof, race detector)”  
2. Microservices & System Design  
   - “Design a highly available payment orchestration service handling millions of TPS.”  
   - “When would you choose gRPC over REST for service-to-service communication?”  
3. Cloud & DevOps  
   - “Explain your approach to deploying Go services on AWS EKS/ECS with Terraform.”  
   - “How do you structure CI/CD pipelines for multiple microservices to ensure safe rollouts?”  
4. Event-Driven Architecture  
   - “Walk me through designing a Kafka-based reconciliation pipeline that guarantees exactly-once semantics.”  
   - “How do you handle backpressure and retries in an event-driven system?”  
5. Security & Compliance  
   - “What are the PCI DSS requirements relevant to backend services?”  
   - “How do you manage secrets in production? (Vault, AWS KMS)”  
6. Behavioral / Culture Fit  
   - “Give an example where you took full ownership of a feature end-to-end.”  
   - “How have you handled a production incident and the subsequent post-mortem?”  

## Questions to Ask Them
1. Team & Roadmap  
   - “How is the Backend team structured, and what are your top priorities for the next 6–12 months?”  
   - “Which new payment modules or markets will I be most involved with?”  
2. Technical Practices  
   - “Can you walk me through your go-service CI/CD process and rollback strategy?”  
   - “How do you enforce API versioning and backward compatibility across services?”  
3. Performance & Scalability  
   - “What were your biggest latency or throughput bottlenecks, and how did you solve them?”  
   - “How do you measure and enforce SLA/SLI for end-to-end transaction latency?”  
4. Security & Compliance  
   - “Which compliance frameworks (PCI, ISO) drive your architecture decisions?”  
   - “How is secret management and key rotation handled in your environments?”  
5. Career Growth & Culture  
   - “What does success look like in the first 3 months for a Senior Engineer?”  
   - “How do you support continuous learning and career progression for senior staff?”  

## Concepts To Know/Review
- Golang fundamentals: goroutines, channels, interfaces, maps vs slices, pointers  
- Performance profiling: pprof, trace, benchmarking  
- Microservices design patterns: circuit breakers, retries, idempotency  
- gRPC vs REST trade-offs  
- Kafka principles: partitions, consumer groups, exactly-once delivery  
- AWS core services: ECS/EKS, Lambda, CloudWatch, IAM, VPC design  
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform basics, CloudFormation  
- CI/CD best practices: blue/green, canary, GitOps  
- PCI DSS essentials, OWASP Top 10, secure coding  
- Observability: distributed tracing (Jaeger), logging, metrics  

## Strategic Advice
- **Tone & Focus**: Be confident and detail-oriented. Frame answers with context, action, result (CAR). Emphasize ownership and impact.  
- **Highlight Learning Agility**: Acknowledge you’re rapidly upskilling in Go—show examples of self-driven Go projects or trainings completed.  
- **Demonstrate Cloud Mastery**: Tie every technical answer back to AWS best practices and operational excellence.  
- **Show Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Provide examples where you partnered with DevOps, Security, and Product to deliver end-to-end.  
- **Red Flags to Watch**:  
  - If the team lacks clear CI/CD or observability practices—ask probing questions.  
  - Gauge support for professional growth in Go expertise (mentorship, training budget).  
  - Clarify visa sponsorship timeline and relocation assistance.  
- **Closing**: Reiterate your passion for fintech, customer obsession, and eagerness to drive innovation at speed while ensuring security and compliance.

Good luck—own the room, steer the conversation toward your cloud and backend strengths, and articulate your Go journey with confidence!
